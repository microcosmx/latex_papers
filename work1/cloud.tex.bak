\begin{abstract}
As the cloud system is becoming more and more popular and widespread these days,
The complexity of cloud systems is also increasing in recent years, leading to increased
effort for maintenance and configuration. Self-adaptive Cloud Systems (SACS) address this issue.
Due to new computing trends, such as pervasive computing, miniaturization of IT leads to
mobile devices with the emerging need for mobile-cloud convergence way of adaptation.
Internet-ware is aiming to make a new definition of future software.
Hence, we propose to analysis the previous adaptive cloud research
and together with mobile computing in adaptation. This paper presents a taxonomy of Adaptive and Self-Managing Cloud Systems
and a survey on SACS. Based on the taxonomy and the survey, we motivate a new
idea on SACS.

%\IEEEPARstart
{T}{he} complexity of current cloud systems is increasing. Due to the growing number of mobile
devices as well as the widespread relatively high speed wireless network, users nowadays can almost
access the service whenever and wherever they want, while at home, at work, or even on the way home/work. Some cloud systems
are running distributed and also kind of integrate with several available, highly specialized cloudlet-like or mobile devices,
e.g. distributed sensor, energy-free mobile, it gather the distributed data streams that operate in an ever-changing
environment with flitter network resources and availability in order to make further decision.
Furthermore, cloud systems are no longer restricted to centralized, tightly controllable areas with stable administrative responsibility, they are somewhat interconnected, leading to truly pervasive, global systems just like Smart Cities or the Internet of Things.

Developing, configuring, and maintaining such cloud systems is a very difficult, error prone, and time consuming task. One
promising way to reduce this effort is self-adaptation.
A self-adaptive cloud system (SACS) is able to automatically modify itself in
response to changes in its operating environment \cite{paper1}. The modification is done by adjusting attributes (parameters) or
artifacts of the system in response to changes in the cloud system itself or in its environment. In recent years, SACS have seen
an increasing level of interest in different research areas like Pervasive Computing, Autonomic Computing \cite{paper35}, and Nature-Inspired (Organic) Computing \cite{paper37}.



SACS provide self-management properties like self-configuration, self-healing in the presence of
failures, self-optimization, and self-protection against threats \cite{paper40}.
For achieving adaptive behavior, basic cloud system properties
are self-awareness and context-awareness \cite{paper39}.
Self-awareness describes the ability of a cloud system to be aware of itself,
e.g. to be able to monitor its own resources(cpu, memory consumption), state, and behavior.
Context-awareness means that the cloud system is aware of its environment, the so called context.
According to the current situation, context can be any stuff that working around the target cloud system.
it could be a machine, a place, or a mobile application which interact with the cloud system.
The cloud system can also uses detector component or even sensor to collect information about its
context and reasons about the information.

In this paper, we provide a structured overview of self-adaptation and approaches for SACS,
and motivate the need for a new perspective on self-adaptation in pervasive computing systems.
Our main contributions are as follows:
First, we develop a taxonomy for self-adaptation cloud system that integrates existing views on self adaptation and specifically context-adaptive cloud systems, which are most relevant to pervasive computing.
Second, we survey existing approaches for engineering SACS. Third, we discuss a new idea of SACS.

These contributions are directly reflected in the structure of the remaining part of the paper. In the next section, our
taxonomy for self-adaptation is presented. In Section 3, we present the previous researches on SACS.
Based on the taxonomy and the researches, in Section 4 we describe a new idea of a SACS.
and finally, we have a conclusion for this paper.

\hfill Nov 1, 2015


{\section{Taxonomy}\label{sec:Taxonomy}}

{I}{n} this section, we summarize different aspects and perspectives on self-adaptation in SACS research and adaptation
in general, and present them in a comprehensive taxonomy for self-adaptation. Our taxonomy
is based on different perspective of self-adaptive cloud systems.
\ref{fig:fig1} shows an overview of our taxonomy. In the remaining part of this section we discuss the different perspective
of our taxonomy.

\begin{figure*}[!t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figure1.png}
\caption{Taxonomy of Self-Adaptive Cloud System}
\label{fig:fig1}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

Before going into the detail of our taxonomy, we have to clarify that the "cloud" here is not referring to the narrow-sense cloud,
besides, it not only include the server technology but also mobile stuff, which have compute and storage capability,
so cloud here can be almost everything, no need to mapping to the IAAS, PAAS or even openstack stuff.




{\subsection{Stage}}

The Stage aspect is related to the MAPE-loop, as the Monitoring, Analysis, Plan, and Execution is the 4 standard steps in
adaptive system, so each step can be a focus area for us to investigate in to make novelty progress for self-adaptive research. some researches are focus on improving monitoring step, e.g. \cite{paper20}, while some others are optimizing analysis step, the plan step is the most popular one, while the execution step is not widely touched.

{\subsection{Granularity}}

In general, a SACS is composed of two different elements: the managed element(s) and the self-adaption logic.
the adaptation logic(the control unit) often stays stable,
while the managed elements can be adapted.
The managed elements are composed of various levels. It can be a entire cloud system such as a PAAS provider,
or part of the cloud system such as a storage component, or even a method of a class.
By the monitoring result, the adaption can be system requirement level, \cite{paper5}
or component/service level, \cite{paper57}
or even class/method level for very specific functional/performance tuning. \cite{paper60}
This is why we have a Granularity aspect.

{\subsection{Cloud}}

In Cloud aspect, we divide them into cloud specific adaptive and non-cloud related adaptive.
the cloud specific refers to the widely-used cloud system: IAAS, PAAS, SAAS.
the adaptive logic mainly focus on the cloud specific mechanism adaptation
and always together with cloud related technology, e.g. hypervisor related stuff.
for PAAS, there are also tow major direction, the runtime and the devops.
runtime refers to the cloud process adaptation, while devops is mainly on
development process and operation process, as PAAS is kind of a middle-layer between
IAAS and SAAS, and its "customer" is usually the developer who always know a lot about IT technology,
so it always face big challenge on various kinds of developers in different experience level.
and others are non-cloud specific system, which can be any kind of software or hardware system \cite{paper9}


{\subsection{Topology}}

Topology is not a new word, but it matters in adaptive cloud system,
the majority of the current and previous research are based on centralized MAPE loop,
Centralized self-adaptation with a central instance for control, Within a centralized adaptation logic,
one sub-system implements the adaptation logic, is responsible for
monitoring the context and all resources, and controls adaptation. Whereas a global maximum-like goal can be achieved due to the
central instance is aware of all information, however, this approach is always not suitable for large systems,
as it has to face a large amount of information, and the tremendous calculation power required.
For large systems, a central approach is hard to
achieve because of the size of the system and real time constraints. \cite{paper19}
so the decentralized approach invented, \cite{paper20} the MAPE can be host on any part of the system,
each part of component can manage itself, and it can also communicate with each other to optimize.
as the fully-decentralized system are often not well planned comparing to centralized system,
there come out semi-decentralized system, which combine these two approach together,
in order to address the disadvantage from both side, and also trying to adopt the advantage from both too.
we can refer to \ref{fig:fig7}.Federation of geo-distributed cloud services which spanning multiple data
centers at different geographical locations can provide a cloud platform with much larger capacities.
the \cite{paper50} proposes efficient proactive algorithms for dynamic, optimal scaling of
a social media application in a geo-distributed cloud by exploiting social influences among users.

\caption{Comparison of adaptation logic structures (AL = Adaptation Logic, MR = Managed Resources, M,A,P,E = MAPE functionality)}
\label{fig:fig7}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}



{\subsection{Objective}}

According to objective aspect, we divide it into mono-objective, bi-objective, and multi-objective,
which means the goal of the adaptive logic. different adaptive logic in adaptive cloud system have different goals,
but most of the previous research will concentrate on one or two goal of their adaptive result.
There also have multi-goal optimization self-adaptive cloud system
which covers a wide range of adaptive points.

{\subsection{Factor}}

Factor is mainly referring to the algorithm of self-adaptive cloud system,
some are fuzzy-based or probability-based, while others are accurate value with programming logic.

{\subsection{Logic}}

There are always both functional and non-functional requirement in each software system,
so does the self-adaptive cloud system, the adaptation result is to meet the functional requirement
or the non-functional requirement is totally different approach.
the non-functional approach is more-like a technical specific \cite{paper46}.
While functional approach includes lots of business stuff in it, which lead to more complexity.

{\section{Survey}}

So far, we presented a consolidated taxonomy based on the characteristic of the existing research.
Next, we are going to take a look at the different approaches of
how a concrete adaptation is implemented. In this
section, we categorize and present these approaches. Furthermore, we link the approaches to the dimensions of our
taxonomy and the MAPE activities.

Our purpose is to present the diversity of the different approaches for SACS
development. We will not discuss every detail of these approaches, what we propose here is to
throw away a brick in order to get a gem, we will
briefly discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and for the interested reader to referred to the cited
works for more detailed information about the approaches.

From a cloud-related perspective, we'll begin with following aspects:

{\subsection{Pure System Specific}}

the pure system means it is not include cloud related technic, so go through those researches,
we have different approaches:

%\begin{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item Requirement-based approaches
\item Architecture-based approaches
\item Service-oriented approaches
\item Programming Logic
\item Hybrid
\end{itemize}
%\end{enumerate}

{\subsubsection{Requirement-based approaches}}

In requirement-based section, what we mostly see is the goal-oriented system.
e.g. \cite{paper5} demonstrate the most crucial challenges
in the engineering of Personalized Web-Tasking (PWT) systems can be addressed
by implementing them as self-adaptive software.
The Personalized Web-Tasking (PWT) proposes the automation
of user-centric and repetitive web interactions to assist users
in the fulfilment of personal goals using internet systems.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{figure3.png}
\caption{Personalized Web-Tasking conceptual elements}
\label{fig:fig3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
it supports three levels of automation: manual
(i.e., the user explicitly specifies which web interactions
correspond to a particular personal goal), assisted by
recommendations (i.e., the system suggests web interactions
to the user), and fully automated (i.e., the system
executes web interactions on behalf of the user)


{\subsubsection{Architecture-based approaches}}

A software architecture is a set of software components, the relations between them, as well as the
properties of both and denotes the high-level structure of software. Regarding adaptation purposes, software
architectures are used for different activities. A SACS must be aware of its structure, which is called self-awareness.
Software architectures can be used for representing the system structure and reasoning about adaptation levels. On the
other hand, software architectures are used for the construction of SACS and defining responsibilities [38]. In this section,
we present architecture-based approaches.

The Rainbow framework \cite{paper57} is one of the most well-known frameworks for SACS.
Driven by external control for self adaptation,
the SACS is divided into an architecture layer and a system layer with the managed resources. The architecture
layer has different components, which define adaptation plans. \ref{fig:fig5}
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figure5.png}
\caption{The Rainbow framework}
\label{fig:fig5}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\cite{paper68} presents the REFRACT framework.In their prior work, they developed algorithms and
conducted a post-hoc analysis demonstrating the possibility
of adapting to software failures by judiciously changing
configurations.REFRACT realizes this idea by building on the self-adaptive Rainbow architecture \cite{paper57}.

As architect level is a kind of high level of a software system, but it also
consist of the implementation of different functional unit detail, so some paper
\cite{paper12} also considered: What is the
impact of the detail system changes on a system¡¯s architecture in a general
case? it's fully of challenges to perfectly extracting the architecture of a system from its
implementation artifacts, and fully of difficulties of tracking the architectural impact
of implementation-level changes.

\cite{paper10} want to schedule resources adaptively with the sole aim of reducing
power consumption, based on a characterization
of energy usage and resource utilization patterns obtained by
monitoring energy consumption in an enterprise data center.
it propose an adaptive feature extraction method to classify
resource utilization patterns from energy consumption data.
It describes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a classifier for energy consumption patterns
\item a reference model for adaptive energy management
\item an adaptive energy pattern extraction method (extract high value/cost process)
\end{enumerate}
which is used to be able to dynamically identify the type of
process that is running on a server, based solely on the energy
consumption. This is needed to make decisions in the Adaptive
and Planning components of a dynamic runtime model using
the MAPE-K loop paradigm.

\cite{paper31} also trying to evolving an Adaptive Industrial Software System
to Use Architecture-Based Self-Adaptation, based on Rainbow framework.

\cite{paper30} established several Controlled Experiment to compare the adaptive systems
of using External Feedback Loops to Improve Design to not(just internal factors).
which proves that applying external feedback loops can reduce control flow
complexity and fault density, and improve productivity.

ConceptCloud\cite{paper70} is an interactive browser for SVN and Git repositories.
Its main novelty is the combination of an intuitive tag cloud
interface with an underlying concept lattice that provides a formal
structure for navigation. This combination allows users to explore
repositories serendipitously, without predefined search goals and
along different navigation paths.


Today¡¯s networked environment is characterized by
a wide variety of heterogeneous systems that dynamically decide
to interoperate to achieve some goal.The \cite{paper43} improves their previous approach to meet not only the functional requirements but also
the performance requirements.Their previous approach can automatically synthesizes connectors (or
mediators) to reconcile protocols diversities and to allow systems interoperability.


{\subsubsection{Service-oriented approaches}}

SOA is a popular word for decades, the services here are refer to the small, encapsulated, and autonomous units of
software that fulfill a specific task. In Service-Oriented Computing
(SOC) such services are used to "support the development of rapid, low-cost, interoperable, evolvable, and massively
distributed functionalities", which is especially match the current PAAS application preferred architect.
From webservice to restful api, the SOA mind is almost everywhere.
The adaptation logic for SOA decides, which services should run. Therefore, dynamic exchange of
services offers structural adaptation capabilities \cite{paper58}.
The problem is, how to build the adaptation logic and how to enable the exchange of services.

\cite{paper59} present a novel approach targeted
at the challenges of automatically composing an SOA
software system in dynamic, unpredictable, and
pervasive SOA software systems. it rely on the
domain expert¡¯s functional and Quality of Service
(QoS) requirements expressed in an activity-oriented
language to automatically generate an "optimal"
architecture. Architecture generation consists of (1)
selection of the appropriate service providers that
satisfy the user¡¯s activities, and (2) application of
suitable behavior patterns to compose the services
into a cohesive software system.

\cite{paper35} is aiming to build and maintain
an assembly of services that, besides functional requirements,
is able to fulfill global quality of service (QoS) and structural
requirements. A set of simulation experiments is used to assess
the effectiveness of our approach in terms of convergence speed
towards the optimal solution, and resilience to failures.
The system we consider thus consists of a set S of N
distributed services S = {S1, . . . , SN }. Services can be
located anywhere and can communicate each other through
a network. Each service has a provided interface, which is an
interface through which it provides functionalities to clients.
Also, each service has a set of required interfaces, that must be
bound to the provided interfaces of other services. centered on the use of a gossip
protocol to achieve decentralized information dissemination and
decision making in order to makes it able to fulfill the goal of best global QoS.

\cite{paper41}  introduce a semantic similarity and semantic nearness service composition method.
The objective of our work is to free
service nodes from adherence to restrictive composition plans. It enables compositions to succeed in dynamic
environments through a decentralized solution even when nodes are unaware of nearby service nodes.

}
\label{fig:fig18}
\end{figure*}




{\subsubsection{Programming Logic}}

Programming logic level is a lower level comparing to service-oriented level.
It focus on the adaptation of class or even method stuff.

\cite{paper60} is aiming to provide a self-management mechanism that can dynamically
monitor and alter the execution of an existing application by
selectively modifying certain procedures to execute remotely
when it is necessary to improve safety and performance.
for example: It automatically converts existing monolithic C applications into a distributed
system semi-automatically based on (1) latency, (2) security.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figure8.png}
\caption{Decision to move data to local server or to use remote function is based on threshold}
\label{fig:fig8}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
it should consider the confidential of the data and also the latency of the network,
to decide whether to execute the method locally or remotely.

\cite{paper42} is a object level programming adaptive methodology.
It proposes a library of self-adaptive containers which
provide a ready route to developing scalable applications with
low programmer overhead. Given an execution environment, the
library flexibly adapts its use of data structures in an effort to
meet programmer-specified service level objectives.
It provides resource-aware container library which dynamically
adjusts the underlying data structure associated
with each container at execution time in order to satisfy
resource constraints.

For example: deque (double-ended queue), list, and vector.
set, multiset, map, and multimap.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figure15.png}
\caption{The architecture of the library}
\label{fig:fig15}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The SLO Store: The SLO store holds all service level
objectives laid down by the configuration interfaces. These
objectives include per operation response times (insertion time,
search time, and deletion time), maximum primary memory
usage, and reliability.
take a look at the following sample SLOs for library container:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 90 percentage of insertion times should be less than 1000ns, and
85percentage of search times should be less than 1200ns.
\item Reliability should be higher than 0.99.
\item Memory consumption should be no more than 7.5GB
\end{enumerate}


The Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is also a example of programming logic aspect.
the program is divided into distinct parts, called concerns. The goal is to use
generic functionality in different classes (cross-cutting concerns). Therefore, logical concerns are separated from the concrete
implementation \cite{paper61}. One example of an AOP language is AspectJ, an extension to Java \cite{paper62}.
Whereas dynamic recomposition
is often related to cross-cutting concerns as QoS, some paper propose AOP for enabling separation of concerns, which
leads to simplified compositional adaptation. some paper show different possibilities to use AOP techniques for
self-adaptation \cite{paper63}.



{\subsubsection{Hybrid}}

In Hybrid approaches, researcher are mostly trying to bring in the advantages from different approach,
e.g. \cite{paper1} propose a hybrid approach to combine the architect change and requirement change together.
if architect modification can not meet the current adaptive requirement, it'll change the requirement(goal model) with the
least influence, and then to see whether there are corresponding architect change match the changed requirement,
and so on, to have a finite two-steps adaptive loop to match the goal.

there are also some special papers which focus on special automation, e.g.
\cite{paper6} propose an original application of dynamic software
reconfiguration techniques to establish a moving target defense
against browser fingerprint tracking. it aim at regularly
changing the four most distinctive elements in a fingerprint:
the operating system, the browser, the list of fonts and the list
of plugins. The main objective here is to automatically
modify the fingerprint a platform exhibits, in order to defense the
browser(user) fingerprint tracking system on the internet, which can more or less, bring in more safety.

\cite{paper32} start a comparative study between the requirement-based adaptive system
and the architect-based system.

Building and deploying cloud applications is a challenging
problem which requires a significant amount of expertise:
the system architect must ensure that all component dependencies
are satisfied, avoid conflicting components, and add the right amount of component replicas to account for quality
of service and fault-tolerance. \cite{paper65} presents a tool that automates the assembly and
deployment of such complex distributed applications.

\cite{paper67} implements AUToCLES, a tool for automatic testing of cloud-based elastic systems.
Given specifications of the test suite and the system under test, AUToCLES automatically instantiates the SUT,
configures the testing scaffoldings, and automatically executes test suites.

{\subsection{Cloud System Specific}}

As for the cloud related technic, it always divided into following aspects:

\begin{itemize}
\item IAAS-based approaches
\item PAAS-based approaches
\begin{itemize}
\item Runtime
\item DevOps
\end{itemize}
\item SAAS-based approaches
\item MCC
\item Hybrid
\end{itemize}

{\subsubsection{IAAS}}

The IAAS is mostly a hypervisor MAPE loop, which can dynamic control the resources of CPU, memory, etc..
in runtime to make better benchmark or revenue.
\cite{paper9} is a good sample of the SACS on IAAS platform.
It propose Hogna, a platform for deploying self-managing
web applications on cloud. The platform enables the
deployment of the applications based on the automation of a set
of operations (starting instances, installing necessary software
and configuring the instances, etc.), and then the continuous
monitoring of the health of the applications. The gathered
monitoring data is analyzed using a performance model and an
action plan is created and executed. Any components involved (for
monitoring, analyzing, planning and deployment changes) can be
customized to fit the needs of the application and/or researcher.
please refer to the figure \ref{fig:fig4}

\begin{figure*}[!t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figure4.png}
\caption{The Hogna Framework¡¯s Architecture}
\label{fig:fig4}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

The \cite{paper24} also provides a Volunteer clouds,
where participants join and leave the
platform and collaborate by sharing computational resources. The
high complexity, dynamism and unpredictability of such scenarios
call for decentralized self-* approaches. It present in its paper a
framework for the design and evaluation of self-adaptive collaborative
task execution strategies in volunteer clouds.
considering one factor: Memory. \ref{fig:fig11}
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figure11.png}
\caption{Memory field supporting the ant¡¯s quest}
\label{fig:fig11}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Considering three factors: Memory, CPU, distance. \ref{fig:fig12}
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figure12.png}
\caption{Memory field overlap with CPU}
\label{fig:fig12}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), to have the best result.

we can see the IAAS always provides the resource elasticity, but it is lack of the metrics for the elasticity itself:
\cite{paper4} propose a reliable metrics for quantifying the
timing aspects and accuracy of elasticity. Based on these metrics,
it also propose a novel approach for benchmarking the elasticity of
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud platforms independent
of the performance exhibited by the provisioned underlying resources. \ref{fig:fig2}
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{figure2.png}
\caption{Illustrating example for accuracy (Under, Over) and timing (A, B) metrics}
\label{fig:fig2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Some researches are focus on the performance tuning,
e.g. \cite{paper3} said: it proposes an architecture for a
self-adaptive prediction suite using an autonomic system
approach. This suite can choose the most suitable prediction
technique based on the performance pattern, which leads to more
accurate prediction results, The hypothesis in this research is that
prediction accuracy of auto-scaling systems can be increased by
choosing an appropriate time-series prediction algorithm based
on the performance pattern over time.

MapReduce is a programming model to process
a massive amount of data on cloud computing. By leaving
programmers the choice of using a combiner, MapReduce
has a risk of performance degradation because aggregating
intermediate data benefits some applications but harms others.
The \cite{paper44} proposes the
Adaptive Combiner for MapReduce (ACMR) to automatically,
smartly, and trainer for getting a better performance
without any interference of programmers.

Real-time monitoring of cloud resources is crucial for a variety of tasks such as performance analysis, workload management, capacity planning and fault detection. Applications producing big data make the monitoring task very difficult at high sampling frequencies.
The \cite{paper48} presents an adaptive algorithm for monitoring big data applications that adapts the intervals of sampling and frequency of updates to data characteristics and administrator needs. Adaptivity allows us to limit computational and communication costs and to guarantee high reliability in capturing relevant load changes.

{\subsubsection{SAAS}}

Actually the SAAS is the most mature one among all the cloud types.
It is directly faces the end user, always provide a login page,
the end user login using their identical id, then will get the system or functionality
they want for their purpose.
So this is the most convenient way of cloud providing,
but also the least confidential way for the customer, e.g. the band system never running
this way.


\cite{paper21}
propose a novel, dynamic and adaptive approach for implementing
design diversity in the cloud market.
The approach uses portfolio theory to construct a diversified portfolio of web service instances,
which are traded from multiple/different cloud providers.
Following will be considered in selection:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Availability. Availability Ai of a web service represents
the probability that that web service is
accessible.
\item Execution time. Execution time Ei measures the delay
in seconds from the moment the web service is
requested to the moment a reply is received.
\item Security. Security of web service Fi represents the
level of security provision of the web service.
\end{enumerate}
The weighted average profit comparing to the weighted average risk have the best result.
\begin{equation}
E_p =\sum_{i=1}^m w_i * a_i .
\end{equation}
E represent the expect profit, w is the weight, a is the assets(service instance).
The same equation as risks.

there are also rule based cloud resource elasticity for application on cloud  \cite{paper23}


{\subsubsection{PAAS}}

PAAS is the most immature technology comparing to IAAS and SAAS,
as it is started just a few year ago, its progress is not that positive as IAAS.
Not only because the cunning "customer" (developer across various levels),
but also it covers a wide range of IT server technology, including almost all the
development language and container runtime, and the corresponding automatic
testing, deploy, monitoring, bug fixing together with regression and move to production.

The Runtime and DevOps are two major part of PAAS system,
so we can see the adaptive logic based on these two aspect.


Runtime:

\cite{paper13} illustrate a method for eliciting, evaluating and ranking
control points for web applications deployed in cloud environments.
The proposed method consists of several phases
that take high-level stakeholders¡¯ adaptation goals and transform
them into lower level MAPE-K loop control points:
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figure6.png}
\caption{ Control Point Model for Runtime Cloud Cost}
\label{fig:fig6}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\ref{fig:fig6}

Show the elicited control points for meeting
low cloud cost adaptation goals in PAAS cloud and application respectively.
Therefore, these control points can be treated as catalogues for reuse.


DevOps:

cloud computing offers a large
number of benefits, such as lower capital costs and a highly
agile environment. Yet, the development of software engineering
practices has not kept pace with this change.

DevOps blurs the traditional boundaries between developers and IT by
ideally bringing together development and operations to
achieve a common goal. "Writing the code" and "making
them work on a platform" are the kind of works done by
different types of people who traditionally worked separately
and implemented entirely different methodologies and workflows.
Successful DevOps requires a change in mindset ¨C all
parties involved need to share responsibility for the success
or the failure of the product.

DevOps is the most challenge part in PAAS platform, which have to provide
the development support and operational support,
it has to support offline plugin for development of its PAAS platform,
or to support online IDE-like stuff.
besides, it also have to combine all the software engineer life cycle activities,
such as debugging, automatic testing, automatic deployment, automatic regression and automatic move to production,
which means move to runtime for release.

There will a lot of problems in the whole software development life cycle,
as PAAS is not well support the traditional local development environment support,
the application architect and its related development language and tools
has to accommodate with what the PAAS platform provided.
e.g. Anticipate is very important, we always do not have well debug environment in DevOps platform,
so we have to anticipant the potential functional defect and performance issue
in order to prepare log and metrics such as performance benchmarks for
production environment analysis instead of directly debugging on it \cite{paper29}.
The \cite{paper38} concludes some lessons and applies those lessons to develop a lightweight
composable/contextual DevOps framework that learns and measure itself to avoid those cultural pitfalls.


CloudWave a smart middle for Devops in clouds, aiming to utilize the principles of DevOps to create an
execution analytics cloud infrastructure where, through the use
of programmable monitoring and online data abstraction, much
more relevant information for the optimization of the ecosystem
is obtained. \cite{paper45}
The approach dynamically adapts cloud services to their environment, resulting in improved service quality and optimized resource use. This is supported with an enhanced cloud monitoring that provides holistic analytics of IaaS and SaaS layer services running on the cloud, leading to CloudWave¡¯s innovative, automated adaptation of the infrastructure and application, as well as enabling DevOps-like data and interfaces for the developer. \ref{fig:fig14}
\begin{figure*}[!t]

}
\label{fig:fig14}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

Aiming to provide the means for efficient collaboration
between development and operations personnel, the DevOps paradigm
is backed by an increasingly growing collection of tools and reusable
artifacts for application management.
Continuous delivery pipelines are
established based on these building blocks by implementing fully automated,
end-to-end application delivery processes, which significantly
shorten release cycles to reduce risks and costs as well as gaining a critical
competitive advantage.
Diverse application environments need to be
managed along the pipeline such as development, build, test, and production
environments.

\cite{paper47} address the need for systematically
specifying and maintaining diverse application environment topologies
enriched with environment-specific requirements in order to implement
continuous delivery pipelines.
Systematically handle and resolve dynamic development requirements
to establish suitable application environments (development, test, production, etc.)
as the key building blocks of continuous delivery pipelines as below.

For specific application: \ref{fig:fig16}

{\subsubsection{MCC}}

The main benefits of cloud computing is reducing downtime and wasted expenditure for servers and other computer equipment. A given company is required to purchase the minimum amount of hardware necessary to handle the maximum points of stress on their system.
To have the unnecessary maximum resource always leads to wasted money. For example, taobao.com, the normal access rate is less then 10 percent of its 11.11.

In the case of mobile cloud computing an additional significant benefit is brought to the table. Many mobile devices have significant constraints imposed upon them because of the importance and desirability of smaller sizes, lower weights, longer battery life and other features. This often severely constrains hardware and software development for these devices. Cloud computing allows devices to avoid these constraints by letting the more resource intensive tasks be performed on systems without these constraints and having the results sent to the device. Thus, cloud computing for mobile devices is a very appealing and potentially lucrative trend.

Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is the combination of cloud computing, mobile computing and wireless networks to bring rich computational resources to mobile users, network operators, as well as cloud computing providers. The ultimate goal of MCC is to enable execution of rich mobile applications on a plethora of mobile devices, with a rich user experience. MCC provides business opportunities for mobile network operators as well as cloud providers. More comprehensively, MCC can be defined as "a rich mobile computing technology that leverages uni?ed elastic resources of varied clouds and network technologies toward unrestricted functionality, storage, and mobility to serve a multitude of mobile devices anywhere, anytime through the channel of Ethernet or Internet regardless of heterogeneous environments and platforms based on the pay-as-you-use principle."

\cite{paper2} presents the cost and
energy aware service provisioning scheme for mobile client in mobile cloud, which
includes two-stage optimization process. In the first-stage optimization process, the
mobile cloud user gives the unique optimal payment to the cloud provider under the
cost and energy constraint and optimizes its benefit. In the second-stage optimization
process, mobile cloud provider runs multiple VMs to execute the jobs for mobile cloud
users; the cloud providers also need to maximize the revenue.

The \cite{paper27} focus on Improving the Energy Efficiency of Mobile Applications using
adaptive Cloud Offloading.

But as the impact of unreliable network connections
on mobile offloading has been experimentally confirmed. The
execution of offloading tasks may suffer from long delays or
even sometimes from failures. The \cite{paper25} introduce an automated restart scheme. It aims
at completing the job using restart with offloading.
When the offloading task fails,
the client may retry offloading or restart the task using the
resources in the local device instead of those in the Cloud. \ref{fig:fig13}
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figure13.png}
\caption{Process of offloading with and without restart}
\label{fig:fig13}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Here is the approaches:
A) No restart, B) Infinite offloading
restart  C) Only local restart n = 1, D) One offloading
restart + one local restart n = 2, E) Two offloading restarts
+ one local restart n = 3. etc...
Pick the one with best performance, for corresponding tasks,
and tune it using historical data.

Motivated by the popularity of prefetch-friendly or delay-tolerant apps (e.g., social
networking, app updates, cloud storage), the \cite{paper36} design and implement an application-layer transmission protocol, AppATP, which leverages
cloud computing to manage data transmissions for mobile apps. Measurements show that significantly amount of energy is consumed by mobile devices during poor connectivity. Based on
this observation, AppATP adaptively seizes periods of good bandwidth condition to prefetch frequently used data with minimum energy
consumption, while deferring delay-tolerant data during poor network connectivity.

The \cite{paper49} also use a genetic algorithm to automatically generate optimal application configurations, based on feature model, at runtime. This optimizes the configuration of the system at runtime according to the available resources. The approach does not entail excessive overhead, and helps the app coping with the resource constrained environment and optimizing its performance.

The \cite{paper53} presents and MCC end user programming sample,
a cloud-based platform to ease the development of context-aware
mobile applications by people without programming skills.
we can refer to its user interface to see. \ref{fig:fig19}

The \cite{paper66} presents Cloud Twin to make mobile applications cross-platform. Cloud Twin natively executes the functionality of a mobile application written for
another platform. It emulates the behaviour of Android applications on
a Windows Phone and transmits the UI actions performed
on the Windows Phone to the cloud server, which then mimics
the received actions on the Android emulator.

Weave Droid\cite{paper69} is an Android application that makes Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) on Android devices possible
and user-friendly. It allows to retrieve applications and aspects and weave them together in several ways. Applications and aspects can be loaded from Google Play, personal
repositories, or the local memory of a device. Then, two
complementary weaving modes are provided: local or remote, using the embedded aspect compiler or the compiler
in the cloud, respectively.


The platform has been designed to be used in a tourism domain. This way, tourism experts
can send tourist information to mobile users according to their context data (indoor/outdoor location, language,
and date and time range). An energy-efficient mobile app has been developed in order to obtain context data
from the user's device and to receive personalized information in real time based on these data. The architecture
and implementation details of the system are presented and the evaluation of the platform by tourism domain
experts is discussed.

\caption{The user interface of the platform}
\label{fig:fig19}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}


{\subsubsection{Hybrid}}

In this section, we'll share the adaptive research across the different cloud system.
\cite{paper20} illustrate a MonPaaS Architecture, it presents a novel monitoring
architecture addressed to the cloud provider and the cloud
consumers. the architecture offers a Monitoring Platform-as-a-Service
to each cloud consumer that allows to customize the
monitoring metrics. The cloud provider sees a complete
overview of the infrastructure whereas the cloud consumer
sees automatically her cloud resources and can define other
resources or services to be monitored, refer to \ref{fig:fig9}

\begin{figure*}[!t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figure9.png}
\caption{MonPaaS Architecture: Nagios for monitoring, NConf is UI, DNX is for deployment of Nagios}
\label{fig:fig9}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

it is based on openstack(IAAS), but implement as a extension of a PAAS system.
The MonPaaS working together with the cloud controller via the message bus.
it present a novel
monitoring Platform-as-a-Service to enable both cloud
provider and cloud consumer to monitor the cloud
infrastructure resources and services.



{\section{A new idea on SACS}}

The survey of approaches showed that the inclusion of context in most approaches is not sufficient. Whereas most
approaches monitor the context, explicit alteration of context is not included in many approaches and the environment
remains uncontrollable for the adaptation logic. As the context can not be well controlled.

A SACS is composed of managed resources and the adaptation logic. The surrounding context is used as input for
the analyzing process. The context is not controlled by the adaptation logic of the SACS, e.g. it is not included in
the planning activity. Nor the context's relationship is not considered by previous research,
e.g. the location of the person maybe illustrate the possible situation(going to subway),
and which is related to possible network situation,
and the time e.g. 18:00 of Friday together with the role of the user may be inferred to
the preference of the user in mobile usage of application.

According to this situation, we plan to take the advantage of the big data technology in order to predict the context
change of from the monitoring information, we use three dimensions to make the adaptation of the SACS system,
please refer to \ref{fig:fig10}

\begin{figure*}[!t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figure10.png}
\caption{Goal: Maximize the user satisfaction based on time/loc/characteristic}
\label{fig:fig10}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

It process its adaptive of SACS(cloud-cloudlet-mobile) based on three dimensions:
Time, Location and Person(character).
Following below MCC rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item weighted average response time of all users
\item constraints: energy consumption(free am, critical pm)
\item Service-oriented approaches
\item Programming Logic
\item Hybrid
\end{itemize}

We are now thinking of several scenario for this new idea, for example:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item online wiki system

    \begin{itemize}
        \item analysis user situation based on time/location/habit
        \item predict user's behavior based on historical data via time/loc/action
        \item time: which day of the week, go to work or back to home etc ...
        \item location: railway, shopping mall, office? not just latitude
        \item behaviors
        \begin{itemize}
            \item search interested wiki topic online and offline(pre-offloading when network and battery is not OK)
            \item comments on wiki online and offline(locally and push once network ready)
            \item post own wiki topic and content (offline when network is not stable,
            submit all the posted topic and content once when network ready)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item online shopping system
    \begin{itemize}
        \item offline goods searching
        \item offline shopping cart
        \item offline purchase and payment process
    \end{itemize}

    \item online weibo system
    \begin{itemize}
        \item similar with online wiki system
        \item plus with offline private mail which may use cloudlet to address
    \end{itemize}

    \item online and offline search engine
    \begin{itemize}
        \item pre-offloading to mobile under specific time/loc/action
        \item offload only related data and search on these data offline
        \item battery low will shrink the usage of network(sync to async to disable)
    \end{itemize}

    \item online book system
    \begin{itemize}
        \item offline searching for books (pre-offloading category)
        \item offline reading( pre-offloading book content o mobile for specific books)
        \item offloading corresponding chapter of the book following the reader's reading history,
        offloading the related content according to the specific chapter
    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

These scenario are the candidates we plan to move on to investigate.
The main goal is to enhance the user experience.


{\section{Conclusion}}

In this paper, we presented a taxonomy and a survey for self-adaptation cloud system, and a new
idea on SACS. Based on literature research and combination of existing surveys, the taxonomy
describes the SACS in different perspectives. The adaptation logic, which
controls the adaptation, must be appropriately designed. Developers need to define the approach, adaptation decision
criteria, and degree of decentralization, as well as the integration of the self-adaptation dimensions for monitoring and
reasoning. For building SACS, different approaches can be found in literature. We classified the approaches in cloud perspectives: IAAS, PAAS, SAAS, MCC, and Hybrid. These categories can overlap.
The new SACS idea introduce a three-dimension approach for optimize the SACS with more accurate
and reasonable means.
